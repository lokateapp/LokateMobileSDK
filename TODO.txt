- connect sdk with mobile be using the multiplatform repositories
- test ios on real phone (simulator has bluetooth scanning always denied)
- remove ios permission handling logic from library (for now), which requires separating scanning logic from permission taking / remove authorization request
- handle permission denied cases accordingly (redirect user to settings page, change ui to inform user about which permission needed to be granted, etc.) / demoApp - LokateSDK can check the authorization status.
- have a more natural way of initializing the SDK in the example app, and also use an architectural pattern like MVVM
- Make LokateSDK more modular to support different BLE protocols
- implement estimote sdk's for the library
- seperate demo applications (composeApp) and library (kmmsdk) into separate repos
- rename kmmsdk -> lokatesdk
- publish kmmsdk onto remote maven repository
- implement deterministic test suite for kmmsdk
